This directory contains master's thesis text source files (*.tex
files and relatives)

In order to generate *.pdf file, you need following programs:

- latexmk (simple perl script, available in most linux distributions)
- bash shell
- graphviz (program for graph generation)

If these conditions are met, you can translate source files into pdf
by simply typing './build.sh' in this directory. (Maybe you'll have to
set executable bit on this shell script.)
